"# LSTM-enso" 
ENSO is one of the most important climate phenomena on Earth due to its ability to change the global atmospheric circulation, which in turn, influences temperature and precipitation across the globe.
This program aims to create a machine learning model that is intended to predict its arrival several seasons in advance regarding its strongest impact on weather and climate, and it's use LSTM algorithm to build the model.
